## Image Design Guidelines for HSP Users

When creating or selecting images for the Fukuro app, please follow these HSP-friendly guidelines:

1. **Gentle Colors**: Use soft, muted colors rather than vibrant or high-contrast ones
2. **Minimal Patterns**: Avoid busy patterns or designs that could be visually overwhelming
3. **Smooth Transitions**: Ensure color transitions are gradual and smooth
4. **Simple Compositions**: Keep image compositions clean and simple
5. **Consistent Style**: Maintain a consistent visual style across all images
6. **Neutral Backgrounds**: Use neutral backgrounds that don't compete with foreground elements
7. **Calming Themes**: Select imagery with calming themes like nature, water, or sky elements
8. **Reduced Brightness**: Ensure images aren't overly bright or sharp
9. **Appropriate Sizing**: Size images appropriately to reduce loading stress
10. **Subtle Animation**: If animated, movements should be subtle and gentle
